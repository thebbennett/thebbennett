### hello ✨

I am a data person. I work in progressive politics as a Data Diretor. Sometimes I write code, but its not often.

- I’m currently the Data Director at Working Families Party, working to build a multiracial party of working people.
- My Github is almost certainly out of date. I doubt there is anything interesting here for you. 
- A better place to check my work is my website and personal blog: [brittanybennett.com](https://www.brittanybennett.com/)  
- I am a far better cook than I am a programmer. If you do reach out to me, ask me about my cooking hobby.
- Pronouns: she/her/hers
