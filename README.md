### hello âœ¨

I am a data person. I work in progressive politics as a Data Diretor. Sometimes I write code, but its not often.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently the Data Director at Working Families Party, working to build a multiracial party of working people.
- ğŸ’¬ My Github is almost certainly out of date. I doubt there is anything interesting here for you. 
- ğŸ“« A better place to check my work is my website and personal blog: [brittanybennett.com](https://www.brittanybennett.com/)  
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her/hers
