### hello âœ¨

I am a tech and data person. I work in progressive politics managing analytics and engineering teams, leading tech innovation, and seeking to find level headed applications for AI to build political power.

I don't really write code much anymore, so there's really nothing here for you to see. 

You can find me at brittanybennett.com
